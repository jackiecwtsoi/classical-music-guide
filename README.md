# Classical Appreciation Guide for Beginners
This is a guide for anyone who wishes to explore classical music, at any time, anywhere. Unlike those that attempt to introduce the vast world and repertoire list of the entire "classical music" genre, this guide serves more as an introduction with tips to *how to find joy from listening to classical music*. I've tried to condense some of my own experiences with learning and appreciating classical music into several steps, and I hope they can help your experience too. Any feedback to this guide is appreciated, and if you're not sure about any part do let me know. Thanks and enjoy!

## Introduction
In my opinion on the high level, there are three major things when it comes to appreciating classical music:
1. A brief understanding on what classical music is and some major moments in classical music;
2. What to look for when it comes to listening to classical music;
3. Cool things about attending a live classical music concert.

But in all honesty, I believe whatever musical genre one is exploring, what ultimately matters is whether the music sounds good and makes one enjoy it. So in this guide, all the theoretical and conceptual stuff about classical music is going to come in later, and the first thing I'd like you to do, is to follow Step 1.

## Step 1. What Do You Think?
What better way to get started on classical music than to listen to it? So I've listed down two pieces that I'd like you to try (in the specified order), and try answer all the questions while you listen. Note that the term "pieces" is a special term in classical music which basically means the same as "songs", and I'll be using "pieces" throughout this guide.
1. [***Moonlight Sonata***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4n8vqlX_o), Ludwig van Beethoven
    1. This piece is called "Moonlight", so try close your eyes while you listen to it. Are there any emotions you feel while you listen? Can you describe them?
    2. This piece has three distinct sections with very different vibes. Can you identify them and what feelings you have for each of them?
    3. How do you like it? Do you think it sounds good or bad?
2. [***Clair de lune***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3u4pQ4WKOk), Claude Debussy
    1. What are some vibes you feel while listening to this piece?
    2. Can you put a scenario where this piece might be played under (e.g. a movie scene, a specific moment etc.)?
    3. "Clair de lune" stands for "moonlight" in French. So this piece has the same name as the other piece you listened to. Is there a difference between the two pieces? Which one do you like better?

Let me know what you think!

## Step 2. The Evolution of Classical Music
Right, so why is it that two pieces both named "Moonlight" seem super different from each other? 

This is largely because these two pieces were written by two different people during two different periods in time. In fact, the first piece (by Beethoven) was written in 1801 and the second (by Debussy) was written in 1905, so there are more than 100 years between them! As one would have guessed, music styles changed quite a lot during this period, and these two pieces belong to entirely different styles in classical music. Similar to popular music these days, like how we went from The Beatles to A-ha to Usher to Justin Bieber and to Doja Cat, classial music also has had many periods with distinct styles.

There are five major periods/eras in classical music:
1. Renaissance
2. Baroque
3. Classical
4. Romantic
5. Modern

But when people usually talk about "classical music", they are referring to eras (2), (3), and (4), which are Baroque, Classical, and Romantic. Each of these three eras has its own distinct sound, and is often associated with some big names. Here's how I remember them:
- Baroque = Bach
    - Big church music (a lot of it is organ music)
    - Big harmonious
    - Big wigs
- Classical = Mozart & Beethoven
    - Nice harmonies, easy to sing along
    - Pieces usually have a stable pace
    - When orchestras started to form
    - No more big wigs
- Romantic = Chopin
    - Very "romantic", a lot of speeding up and slowing down in pieces
    - Sometimes not too harmonious, a lot of weird sounds and harmonies coming out
    - But many "epic" stuff happening, like big symphonies with hundreds of people playing in orchestras

### Listening For Fun
I've put down a piece of music from each era. Have a listen (perhaps just the first two mins of each), and have a think about these questions:
- What feeling do you get from listening to each piece?
- Are these pieces any different? If so, how?
- Which one do you like better? Why?
1. Baroque era - [***Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdsyNwUoON0), Johann Sebastian Bach
2. Classical era - [***Symphony No. 1 in C major, Op. 21***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVKdd-gI_aQ), Ludwig van Beethoven
3. Romantic era - [***Piano Concerto in E minor, Op. 11***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=614oSsDS734), Frédéric Chopin

### Fun Fact
Orchestras and live concerts these days tend to put more focus on the Romantic and Classical eras, whereas music from the Baroque era is played less often. Why do you think that is?

## Step 3. Alright... But I Still Don't Understand It...
Yeah, so now let's go back to this very basic question: *What is "classical music" to start with?*

To put it simply, "classical music" refers to music that was once popular in the western world (a very big generalization here but you know what I mean) up until maybe the 1900s. It is called "classical" because people after the 1900s started listening to other styles (e.g. blues, rock, rap etc.) and so they started calling the old style "classical" instead. So it is "popular music" for people before roughly the 1900s.

This means that classical music was a BIG deal for the majority of people in Europe for a long period before the 1900s. This also means that A LOT of money and resources went into the development of this type of music during the time, which in turn led to the establishment of many many fundamental things that STILL influence popular music today (even Drake). Here are some of them:
- The idea of "harmony" and its fundamental principles - which every single pop song today utilizes
- Form and structure of a piece of music - in which the current pop song convention of Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus is derived from
- Rhythmic regularity - things like beats of 3 and beats of 4 that are very common in pop songs today

### Listening to A Piece of Classical Music
Like when we listen to pop songs, I'd say the best way to listen to some classical music is to look for these three things:
- Pattern
    - Are there parts in the piece that are oddly similar to each other? Do melodies repeat?
    - Does the piece start with a fast pace, does some slow stuff, and then comes back to a fast pace?
- Emotion
    - Are there particular parts that make you feel a certain emotion?
    - Are there climaxes in the piece? What makes them seem like climaxes?
- One Thing That You Remember
    - What is that one thing about the piece that you remember from your listening?
    - Do you like it? Do you not like it?

I'd say the emotion part is really the focus here, because that is what ultimately sticks with you about the piece. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ogVYKwgFJc&t=2s) on how to look for expression and emotion in classical music.

### Symphonies and Concertos
In the concert we will attend, we will be listening to a  **symphony** as well as a **violin concerto**.

A "symphony" is basically a big piece performed by an "orchestra", a group of people (goes up to 100 something) who each plays an instrument. A symphony is usually quite long, ranging between 30 minutes to even 5 hours.

A "concerto" is like the symphony (played by the orchestra, often long as well), but with the addition of a "soloist" who plays some instrument. So a "violin concerto" means that the piece features an orchestra plus a solo musician who plays the violin, and the solo musician is often a star musician who has very strong technical skills.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Juq2xF32lo) to learn about how to listen to these kinds of big pieces.

## Step 4. Attending Live Classical Music Concerts
There are some things I usually do before attending a classical music concert, whether it be a solo performance or a symphony/concerto:
1. Listen to the pieces on the concert programme - to get familiar with how the music sounds (so that I can hum to it during the actual concert HEHE)
2. Have a read on who wrote these pieces and why they wrote them - to get a general understanding on the context to which a piece of music was born, what purpose it served etc.

### Listening for Fun
Programme for our upcoming concert:
1. [***Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFl9xuYP5T8), Johannes Brahms
2. [***Concerto for Orchestra, Sz. 116, BB 123***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG26BMDVR9E), Béla Bartók

## Concluding Words
All of this is of course optional, as the journey is different for everyone and one thing might or might not work for you. The most important thing is to have fun during the process! Thanks for reading!
