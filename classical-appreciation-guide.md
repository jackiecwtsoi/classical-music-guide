# Classical Appreciation Guide for Beginners
This is a guide for anyone who wishes to explore classical music, at any time, anywhere. Unlike those that attempt to introduce the vast world and reportoire list of the entire "classical music" genre, this guide serves more as an introduction with tips to *how to find joy from listening to classical music*. I've tried to condense some of my own experiences with learning and appreciating classical music into several steps, and I hope they can help your experience too. Any feedback to this guide is appreciated, and if you're not sure about any part do let me know. Thanks and enjoy!

## Introduction
In my opinion on the high level, there are three major things when it comes to appreciating classical music:
1. A brief understanding on what classical music is and some major moments in classical music;
2. What to look for when it comes to listening to classical music;
3. Cool things about attending a live classical music concert.

But in all honesty, I believe whatever musical genre one is exploring, what ultimately matters is whether the music sounds good and makes one enjoy it. So in this guide, all the theoretical and conceptual stuff about classical music is going to come in later, and the first thing I'd like you to do, is to follow Step 1.

## Step 1. What Do You Think?
What better way to get started to classical music than to listen to it? So I've listed down two pieces that I'd like you to try (in the specified order), and try answer all the questions while you listen. Note that the term "pieces" is a special term in classical music which basically means the same as "songs", and I'll be using "pieces" throughout this guide.
1. [***Moonlight Sonata***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4n8vqlX_o), Ludwig van Beethoven
    1. This piece is called "Moonlight", so try close your eyes while you listen to it. Are there any emotions you feel while you listen? Can you describe them?
    2. This piece has three distinct sections with very different vibes. Can you identify them and what feelings you have for each of them?
    3. How do you like it? Do you think it sounds good or bad?
2. [***Clair de lune***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3u4pQ4WKOk), Claude Debussy
    1. What are some vibes you feel while listening to this piece?
    2. Can you put a scenario where this piece might be played under (e.g. a movie scene, a specific moment etc.)?
    3. "Clair de lune" stands for "moonlight" in French. So this piece has the same name as the other piece you listened to. Is there a difference between the two pieces? Which one do you like better?

Let me know what you think!
